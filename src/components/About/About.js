                        <p>In High School I was honored as the lead thespian of my graduating year. 
                            Immediately out of High School I became certified and licensed in massage therapy. 
                            A few years after that I was managing the Pro Audio department at Guitar Center. 
                            That led me to becoming a professional DJ for the greater part of my adult life so far. 
                            After some time in college studying physics and calculus I discovered the greatest passion I've ever held.<br />

                            My name is Axel Jorgensen and I am a coder.</p>
